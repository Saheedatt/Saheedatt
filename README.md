### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Saheedat Afolabi.
I am a <b>Self taught developer...for most part.</b>

An aspiring frontend developer.

I am currently learning React.js. I think I am having a great time with it. I like it a lot. 

Pronouns: <b>She/Her.</b>

I am currently working on a social media app project using React.js
  
Fun facts: I love to read novels and I am fascinated by the human anatomy.
 
 I am looking for help with the use of the google-oauth@react. I can't seem to figure out how to do the google authentication properly for a project I'm working on.
 
 I am currently trying to complete a #30daysofreact challenge where I ensure that I code using react and learn something new every day.
